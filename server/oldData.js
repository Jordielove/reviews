I have never even come close to losing grip even in the hot sun while all sweaty. I like how the weight ends up at the head rather than the middle. This gives me the most force where I need it. I have pretty much stopped using all my hammers. (Who doesn\'t have like 10).Whereas before I might have just gone in my box to grab another to keep working if i temporarily misplaced mine, now I will stop what I am doing and find this one. ',

Thank you Home Depot for the best special I’ve ever seen for such quality tools. Not only are they amazing tools but they are so beautiful that I immediately set about building a tool cabinet that would do justice to their style and function. During construction I used 8 of the 9 cordless power in this combo. I was already the proud owner of a DeWalt Contractors bench saw. It was perfect for cutting the plywood into perfect pieces.',

A few highlights of the nailer: 1. full range of nail lengths 2" - 3-1/2" 2. double depth adjustment for fine tuning 3. excellent balance and size 4. no gas cartridge The magazine is about half of my Bostich N88RH.Doesn\'t bother me, but you will need to reload more often. The reload is quick and easy anyway. The balance is nice. It\'s 9 pounds, pretty typical, but a little more compact, so the weight is centered more towards your trigger finger.The kick is also very manageable on this nailer.If you are used to air your will be pleasantly surprised.',

The key upgrade is a dual-speed motor selector feature, which provides two speeds for different size nails. After using the DCN692 Framing Nailer, I am quite impressed with it’s performance. I fired approximately 400 nails(2 3 / 8” ring - shank) with the DCN692 Nailer, and amazingly the battery still had a 2/3’s charge.remaining on the 4 amp-hour battery. Being free from a cumbersome air hose is very beneficial for outside work. Although the nailer looks top heavy, it actually balances right at the trigger.',

It’s a real machine; quality construction with beautiful shinny finish; turned on, adjusted the temp and it cooled our room. Installation is easy, the pieces fit together. Last year I bought the LG 10,000 which wasn’t powerful enough for our sunny dinning and front rooms. This new LG 14K unit works great, cost some more, is much quieter. Our son and grandson both agree saying “that’s quieter” as we talked while it was cooling the room on a hot day. I moved the 10K unit to the back room of our manufactured home. Together we cool our whole house now.',

The fan provides nice, but not overpowering wind flow, which helps me sleep a lot better. The fan operation is very quiet. The lighting is warm and suffices as the sole source of room light (again, 8x8 room). I like that energy efficient LED bulbs are used. The remote control feels kind of cheap but it adds a lot of convenience and is intuitive and easy to use. I will add a couple of caveats: 1) I had an electrician do the installations, so I can\'t speak to the ease or difficulty of that step; 2) I was replacing a 25 year old, wobbly, and dated- looking fan, so I was pretty easy to please.I sleep with fan on, so I get 7 hours of use daily, no problems or issues.I recommend the Hunter Dempsey ceiling fans.',

The heads of both the 3 inch screws to install the canopy stripped while installing. I had to use replacement 3 inch screws. The all three machine head screws to install the fan onto the canopy had trouble catching into the canopy. When I tried screwing the screws without the fan, it seemed like the canopy holes had not been properly tapped to accept the screws. It was almost like the screw holes were tapped for a smaller screw. I was able to get them in without the fan in place but it was a battle. With fan in place, I could get one screw in but do nothing with the other two screws accept strip their ends. When I called Hunter for replacement screws, they wanted $6 to send them.

                review: 'This is a great fan, we have three of them now, two 52 inch and one 44 inch, all in Brushed Nickel. We really like the modern clean style and no exposed switches or screws.Even the seldom used(never in our case) reversing switch is smartly tucked away behind the globe, maintaining the clean, uncluttered look. The one thing we don\'t care for is the remote. It looks like cheap recycled plastic and is shaped oddly. However, we are using the Casablanca 99195 Fan & Light Wall Remote Control with this fan without issue and it makes it really nice. I wish Hunter officially supported this remote as it paired fine and works great.',

                review: 'I am a fan of this fan. We installed this fan into the kid\'s playroom and it is great for moving the air around in there, as the room is somewhat closed off, only have 2 doors.Essentially it functioned as a dining room.The 52" span is perfect for the room size. Since I already had an existing light fixture, installed was somewhat easy. Keep in mind to follow the instructions carefully as there are a lot of steps when putting the fan together. The nice part is, the bracket your first install acts as a hanger so you can wire the fan with out having to hold it. This fan does not come with a remote, so I bought a universal remote and installed that with it. The receiver fit perfectly in the bracket. Installation took about an hour and a half, as I went slowly to make sure everything was correct. The blades have 2 sides and you can use either one. The light kit below is really nice, with the wire cage and it comes with 2 Edison style bulbs(which I did not use, as they were not bright enough for the room). Overall, it is a great fan and would recommend.',

                review: 'Looks amazing! The fan comes very well packaged and includes the antique style LED bulbs. The instructions are exceptionally well written and diagrammed. I\'ve installed many ceiling fans and these are some of the easiest instructions to follow that I\'ve seen. With that said, it is a time consuming installation. All you really need is a Philips screwdriver and a step-ladder, but when allotting time, allow at least a couple of hours if you\'re not a pro.Since the packaging is very thorough, there is some disassembly required to the included pieces in order to complete the assembly, so don\'t be surprised if you have left-over parts (see pic - rubber motor stabilizers and screws, plastic hole plug). The finish is smooth and very attractive and the reversible blade colors are great looking and versatile. I used the grayish wood, but the blades can easily be flipped because they just clip on (securely). So there\'s no disassembly or tedious unscrewing if you change décor and want to switch! The motor runs smooth and the fan has no wobble.It will make a great quality, eye- catching addition to your home.',

It\'s lovely stainless steel, but not the type that you can\'t keep clean or put a magnet on.It has a handle on the front that I like better than any dishwasher I\'ve use before, no weird little places to grab and I can hang a nice dish towel on it if I like. The buttons are located on the top of the machine and I love this feature because there are no ugly interfaces on the front to ruin its appearance, it\'s concealed.It\'s push button, super simple to make my selection, hit start and close it. But the best part? I don\'t hardly hear it.No noisy water rushing sounds, clanking moving parts. ',

The door is not flimsy, it can be left open a few inches or more in any position(see pic). Couple of things I don\'t like is that it does not dry the dishes all the way and I feel the top rack should have another enclosure piece/ flap to keep dishes in their place. 1 flap is not enough for me because I wash a lot of tupperware that easily gets flipped over. (see pic for tupperware container flipped over and filled with dirty water) It should be noted after installation the door hinges needed lubricant badly.The door was hard to get open and it made a horrible screeching sound when opening.',

There is one drop of water on the bottom of most dishes and most forks, knives and spoons. This is using the Normal + Heat Dry + High Heat options. It is about the same when you don\'t select High Heat.However, when I finally got the free sample of the drying agent and added it to the dispenser, the dishwasher works so much better than without it.',

Second, in that near three hour cycle, it doesn\'t even properly clean dishes. I have to touch up by hand or run through a second time almost half of the dishes, especially ones on the bottom.

                review: 'I\'m continually impressed with the performance of this mower.For my 1.5 acres it takes 60 minutes with Ryobi 0 turn mower compared to almost 2 hours with my previous lawn tractor. Battery life has been very good with 45 - 50 % charge left after completing the job.I run high ground speed and high blade speed with no worries about being able to finish the job. The mower does a great job leaving a very even cut. There are a few issues though. 1. There\'s no 12 volt accessory outlet to power a tow behind sprayer. I had to fabricate a way to mount a battery on my sprayer to be able to use it. I also added a foot switch to control the on/off for the pump. 2. Traction for the rear tires is very poor but that\'s expected with the turf tires. When mowing low angle slopes lengthwise the rear of the mower has a tendency to want to slide down hill. The tires will also spin when going uphill on some of my yard. To fix this I replaced the rear wheels with some with a more aggressive tread. I just have to be more careful now when turning as to not tear up my lawn, but I can live with that.',

I estimate that the mower is ~45" wide with the chute up. I have to say that the build quality is even better than the Ryobi RM480ex that I also have. I just finished my first mow of my 1.5 acres with this mower and even running in "slow" mode, it was definitely faster that mowing with the traditional riding mower. The larger wheels and more cushioned seat made for a softer ride. There is a definite learning curve to zero turns.

This one is slightly larger and the build feels more solid. Now the bad.

The trimmer performs perfectly and did not require any assembly out of the box.The printed instructional manual is very clear and perfect to answer any questions.regarding the features and operation of the tool.The blade length is 22 inches and has a guard.Unfortunately, it was supposed to come with a debris deflector but ours was missing out of the box.

It is light and easy to hold which is a major plus when cutting a lot of hedges. The operation is extremely easy, basically plug and play.

                review: 'I have owned many different lawnmowers over the past 55 years, but nothing compares to the ease of use, easy start, maneuverability, minimal storage space, and cutting quality of this lawnmower! Hands down the best mower on the market in my opinion! The large wheels on the rear, and the “touch control” of the front wheel drive (drive bar underneath the handle bar) make this mower unbelieveably easy to maneuver around landscaping in any condition. The only improvement I could suggest would be to add a larger “sealing” strip where the lawn clippings bag meets the discharge chute cover to reduce the amount of grass blow-by into the face of the operator.

                review: 'TThe Toro Recycler 22 in. SmartStow mower stows away nicely along the wall of our garage. While the mulch attachment is easy to put in place, it does seem like over time it might not stay firmly in place with only the small plastic connection points under the springloaded flap where it attaches. However, this likely won’t be an issue if treated well. The Washout port for connecting the hose to wash the underside of the deck is a nice feature, but I have found that it still needs to be turned over for a thorough cleaning. This appaers to be due to the many places grass still managers to lodge, which the spray does not reach well enough to dislodge when using the washout port.',

Added the oil, put in fresh gas and clipped the bag to the frame and put it on. It started on the first pull and it has done so ever since, it never has any problem with cutting thick grass it has more than enough power. The engine has a lot of torque to it, the OHV and OHC saves a lot of fuel compared to my old flat head mower. The deck and handle are very well balanced and sturdy feeling, the Honda Smart Drive system is nice to use and very simple. Just push down and off the mower goes. ',

                review: 'Mediocre at best. We chose the Samsung model to match our 5 year old Samsung refrigerator which we love. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about this Samsung microwave. The appearance is attractive and functions as it should. The mounting hardware matched the GE that it replaced which made installation fairly easy.The charcoal filter was a little difficult to install and actually took more time to install than the overall installation of the microwave itself.The parts that were required to be removed in order to install the filter felt like they were going to break as they were being removed.The vent fan is noticeably quieter than our previous GE and performs well.',

I believe that the majority of people will grab the handle near the bottom. The top and bottom of the handle are made up of several parts.

                review: 'After 3 fridges, 1 service call, dozens of phone calls and emails, and 53 days after paying, I finally have a fridge that works. The first fridge was damaged on the truck. The second fridge had what I thought was a minor crack on a plastic clip. I tried calling Home Depot but kept getting routed to Whirlpool through their baffling phone menu system. Whirlpool would not do an exchange and insisted on sending a service technician. I relented, even though I paid for a new fridge, and scheduled a service call. The technician determined the frame was bent, the condenser fan shroud was cracked and the fan was not spinning and not blowing air across the condenser. No wonder the fridge was so noisy.',

                review: 'Shopping and price comparing has enormous benefits! Our relatively new 23 cubic foot high end French door prematurely failed in only 17 months of use thereby spoiling both frozen & refrigerated foods. Desperate situation compounded by the fact having been burned by the one currently highly rated brand we were now hesitant considering purchasing the same brand. Wife and I hence spent hours & hours researching competitive brands using Home Depot’s posted reviews simply because they had quantities of posted reviews which we trust in making our decision for a replacement refrigerator.

The freezer is also so large that we haven\'t filled it yet.We bought this as a Christmas gift for ourselves and we are very happy and to top it all off, it was on sale.I would buy it again in a heartbeat.',

This one bolted up directly without any changes. I had to remove the factory installed power cord and wire the disposal directly (I assume that\'s according to code when the house was built, so I didn\'t change it and personally saw no reason to convert to a plug). If you have to hardwire it, I recommend disconnecting the disposal from the sink (easy to do), flip it over, remove the cover, rewire the disposal and reattach to the sink.',

I finished assembling the umbrella yesterday and so far it\'s working well for the intended purpose.That said, I\'ve encountered multiple design flaws and had to repair the crank mechanism after it literally popped out of the crank assembly. The screws holding the crank in place are tiny self-tap screws seated in plastic, and hardly adequate. It took me an hour to figure the clutch mechanism out and fit it back in place, and then I ended up replacing the screws with something much more substantial. ',
