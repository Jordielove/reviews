I have never even come close to losing grip even in the hot sun while all sweaty. I like how the weight ends up at the head rather than the middle. This gives me the most force where I need it. I have pretty much stopped using all my hammers. (Who doesn\'t have like 10).Whereas before I might have just gone in my box to grab another to keep working if i temporarily misplaced mine, now I will stop what I am doing and find this one. ',

                review: 'This miter saw is a great value for the money and is very accurate out of the box. The saw meets my expectations for home projects, and it is a must for cutting crown molding. It saves time and energy as opposed to using a manual miter saw. The sliding feature is great for cutting wider boards, and the 15-amp motor is more than sufficient power to get the job done. The saw is very sturdy. I would definitely recommend this saw for DIYers.',

I bought a new 20V Max DeWalt drill and Driver combo two years ago. I always wanted to get additional batteries and another charger for those. I also wanted to be able to use an older DeWalt 18V drill in my shop, but needed replacement batteries for it. This kit took care of all of these issues. Now I can have one drill in my vehicle, one in my shop, and a charger in both locations.',

A few highlights of the nailer: 1. full range of nail lengths 2" - 3-1/2" 2. double depth adjustment for fine tuning 3. excellent balance and size 4. no gas cartridge The magazine is about half of my Bostich N88RH.Doesn\'t bother me, but you will need to reload more often. The reload is quick and easy anyway. The balance is nice. It\'s 9 pounds, pretty typical, but a little more compact, so the weight is centered more towards your trigger finger.The kick is also very manageable on this nailer.If you are used to air your will be pleasantly surprised.',

The key upgrade is a dual-speed motor selector feature, which provides two speeds for different size nails. After using the DCN692 Framing Nailer, I am quite impressed with it’s performance. I fired approximately 400 nails(2 3 / 8” ring - shank) with the DCN692 Nailer, and amazingly the battery still had a 2/3’s charge.remaining on the 4 amp-hour battery. Being free from a cumbersome air hose is very beneficial for outside work. Although the nailer looks top heavy, it actually balances right at the trigger.',

It’s a real machine; quality construction with beautiful shinny finish; turned on, adjusted the temp and it cooled our room. Installation is easy, the pieces fit together. Last year I bought the LG 10,000 which wasn’t powerful enough for our sunny dinning and front rooms. This new LG 14K unit works great, cost some more, is much quieter. Our son and grandson both agree saying “that’s quieter” as we talked while it was cooling the room on a hot day. I moved the 10K unit to the back room of our manufactured home. Together we cool our whole house now.',

I use these buckets for weeding, carrying tools, and storing stuff (cement, sand, potting soil, salt for the driveway). I even built a dust collection system that fronts the shop vac in the workshop (I got the idea from Youtube -- the bucket prevents fine dust from clogging the shop vac filter and protects the motor). There once was a man from Nantucket, who liked to make things with a bucket. He watched things on youtube and discovered a proposal.It made him a dust- suck - disposal. ...not my best work, but you get it.Great bucket!',

The fan provides nice, but not overpowering wind flow, which helps me sleep a lot better. The fan operation is very quiet. The lighting is warm and suffices as the sole source of room light (again, 8x8 room). I like that energy efficient LED bulbs are used. The remote control feels kind of cheap but it adds a lot of convenience and is intuitive and easy to use. I will add a couple of caveats: 1) I had an electrician do the installations, so I can\'t speak to the ease or difficulty of that step; 2) I was replacing a 25 year old, wobbly, and dated- looking fan, so I was pretty easy to please.I sleep with fan on, so I get 7 hours of use daily, no problems or issues.I recommend the Hunter Dempsey ceiling fans.',

The heads of both the 3 inch screws to install the canopy stripped while installing. I had to use replacement 3 inch screws. The all three machine head screws to install the fan onto the canopy had trouble catching into the canopy. When I tried screwing the screws without the fan, it seemed like the canopy holes had not been properly tapped to accept the screws. It was almost like the screw holes were tapped for a smaller screw. I was able to get them in without the fan in place but it was a battle. With fan in place, I could get one screw in but do nothing with the other two screws accept strip their ends. When I called Hunter for replacement screws, they wanted $6 to send them. Again the metal for these screws were too soft too. Very frustrated as the fan still hangs from the ceiling partially assembled.',

We installed this fan into the kid\'s playroom and it is great for moving the air around in there, as the room is somewhat closed off, only have 2 doors.Essentially it functioned as a dining room.The 52" span is perfect for the room size. Since I already had an existing light fixture, installed was somewhat easy. Keep in mind to follow the instructions carefully as there are a lot of steps when putting the fan together. The nice part is, the bracket your first install acts as a hanger so you can wire the fan with out having to hold it. This fan does not come with a remote, so I bought a universal remote and installed that with it. The receiver fit perfectly in the bracket. Installation took about an hour and a half, as I went slowly to make sure everything was correct. The blades have 2 sides and you can use either one. The light kit below is really nice, with the wire cage and it comes with 2 Edison style bulbs(which I did not use, as they were not bright enough for the room). Overall, it is a great fan and would recommend.',

                review: 'Looks amazing! The fan comes very well packaged and includes the antique style LED bulbs. The instructions are exceptionally well written and diagrammed. I\'ve installed many ceiling fans and these are some of the easiest instructions to follow that I\'ve seen. With that said, it is a time consuming installation. All you really need is a Philips screwdriver and a step-ladder, but when allotting time, allow at least a couple of hours if you\'re not a pro.Since the packaging is very thorough, there is some disassembly required to the included pieces in order to complete the assembly, so don\'t be surprised if you have left-over parts (see pic - rubber motor stabilizers and screws, plastic hole plug). The finish is smooth and very attractive and the reversible blade colors are great looking and versatile. I used the grayish wood, but the blades can easily be flipped because they just clip on (securely). So there\'s no disassembly or tedious unscrewing if you change décor and want to switch! The motor runs smooth and the fan has no wobble.It will make a great quality, eye- catching addition to your home.',

                review: 'Well with all my reviews I like to add pictures of what the item looks like, due to the holiday season, was not able to get this up but wanted to do my review. Was shipped pretty quickly which I appreciate.The Ellard Ceiling Fan from Home Decorators is very unique looking with it\'s cage Light Kit, gorgeous iron finish and will fit in with most home décor styles. The Ellard Ceiling Fan has reversible blades which I like. The ceiling fan is for indoor use only. The blades give you 2 different color options grey and walnut, which are 2 neutral colors that will go with most home décor. This ceiling fan comes with the Downward and also included is 7 watt Edison style LED energy saving light which we love. The airflow for the fan is 4659. The fan comes with Trimount install for Angled, Stnadard or your Flushmount Applications. The Ellard Ceiling fan is a 3 speed with Reversible Control. This ceiling fan comes with a decorative canopy ring cover to hide any exposed screws.',

But opening it up, seeing how easy it is to clean and the features it has from water jets on the bottom, middle AND top!.

                review: 'First let\'s talk appearance: I love the look of my new Samsung dishwasher. It\'s lovely stainless steel, but not the type that you can\'t keep clean or put a magnet on.It has a handle on the front that I like better than any dishwasher I\'ve use before, no weird little places to grab and I can hang a nice dish towel on it if I like. The buttons are located on the top of the machine and I love this feature because there are no ugly interfaces on the front to ruin its appearance, it\'s concealed.It\'s push button, super simple to make my selection, hit start and close it. But the best part? I don\'t hardly hear it.No noisy water rushing sounds, clanking moving parts. ',

The first 3 photos show how I loaded the dishwasher with two meals\' worth of dishes for my wife and me. Details are in the captions. Normal cycle, High Temp and Heat Dry options, 1 scoop of Bubble Bandit detergent (Google it) in the main wash chamber. Didn\'t purge the hot water line. The last photo shows the result of a torture test.A workman\'s mug crusted with coffee and almond milk residue was deliberately placed in the right rear corner of the top rack farthest from the reach of the wash arm.

The machine is very quiet, and has just a few basic settings, which I really like. I have two complaints. 1) the top left rack rail was installed backwords, so I had to take it apart, and figure out how to get it flipped.It took about 30 minutes to fix, and to put the rails back on.This brings me the second issue. 2) the gray plastic end caps that keep the rack from sliding right off and crashing are flimsy, tricky to attach, and fall off easily.One has come off 4 times and one of these days one will break or get stepped on.',

The door is not flimsy, it can be left open a few inches or more in any position(see pic). Couple of things I don\'t like is that it does not dry the dishes all the way and I feel the top rack should have another enclosure piece/ flap to keep dishes in their place. 1 flap is not enough for me because I wash a lot of tupperware that easily gets flipped over. (see pic for tupperware container flipped over and filled with dirty water) It should be noted after installation the door hinges needed lubricant badly.The door was hard to get open and it made a horrible screeching sound when opening.',

But after using it for a few weeks I found the following: Without using the drying agent, I have to hand dry more than half of the dishes and utensils. There is one drop of water on the bottom of most dishes and most forks, knives and spoons. This is using the Normal + Heat Dry + High Heat options. It is about the same when you don\'t select High Heat.However, when I finally got the free sample of the drying agent and added it to the dispenser, the dishwasher works so much better than without it.',

Second, in that near three hour cycle, it doesn\'t even properly clean dishes. I have to touch up by hand or run through a second time almost half of the dishes, especially ones on the bottom.

The tractor has a lot of power, the cutting system is incredible, it has no starting problems, and it’s extremely easy to clean.As a side note, the fuel I use is NO Ethanol and works great with it.One thing, I haven’t had the chance to use is the cutting mode of it yet.To be honest, I was going to by a Toro Cero but when I saw the price I thought it was just way too expensive for cutting grass, and I’m just glad I ended up buying this one, its perfect!

                review: 'I\'m continually impressed with the performance of this mower.For my 1.5 acres it takes 60 minutes with Ryobi 0 turn mower compared to almost 2 hours with my previous lawn tractor. Battery life has been very good with 45 - 50 % charge left after completing the job.I run high ground speed and high blade speed with no worries about being able to finish the job. The mower does a great job leaving a very even cut. There are a few issues though. 1. There\'s no 12 volt accessory outlet to power a tow behind sprayer. I had to fabricate a way to mount a battery on my sprayer to be able to use it. I also added a foot switch to control the on/off for the pump. 2. Traction for the rear tires is very poor but that\'s expected with the turf tires. When mowing low angle slopes lengthwise the rear of the mower has a tendency to want to slide down hill. The tires will also spin when going uphill on some of my yard. To fix this I replaced the rear wheels with some with a more aggressive tread. I just have to be more careful now when turning as to not tear up my lawn, but I can live with that.',

                review: 'I just received the Ryobi Zero Turn mower and verified that it will fit through a 46.5" gate with the chute up (barely). I estimate that the mower is ~45" wide with the chute up. I have to say that the build quality is even better than the Ryobi RM480ex that I also have. I just finished my first mow of my 1.5 acres with this mower and even running in "slow" mode, it was definitely faster that mowing with the traditional riding mower. The larger wheels and more cushioned seat made for a softer ride. There is a definite learning curve to zero turns. One thing I noticed is that as soon as you hit the brake, it won\'t go again until you bring the arms to center.',

I did run into a little bit of an issue while chiseling out the hinges as the outside shell of the door would not chisel as well as the inside of the door which left a rough edge that needed to be sanded. However, I found the rest of the install was easy, even with a rather crooked door frame. Overall the install was easy and a success.',

Setting the angle back to 90 degrees was more difficult than I expected from a tool of this price and overall quality. The mechanism for adjusting the angle of the footplate is awkward. You kind of have to eyeball the angle markers to the alignment feature, which is a tiny notch on the washer plate - poor design. The footplate may shift while tightening the locking screw if you\'re not careful.I don\'t know how other jigsaws in this class compare - this was an upgrade from an old cheapo I\'ve had for a long time, but I\'ve got to say it was easier to adjust the footplate angle on the cheapo.',

I was wrong, and my knees hurt for weeks after just a few hours spent kneeling on the floor, fiddling with those samples. I knew that if I did not find a way to kneel without hurting my delicate knees that I would be unable to do the project myself. ',

While the mulch attachment is easy to put in place, it does seem like over time it might not stay firmly in place with only the small plastic connection points under the springloaded flap where it attaches. However, this likely won’t be an issue if treated well. The Washout port for connecting the hose to wash the underside of the deck is a nice feature, but I have found that it still needs to be turned over for a thorough cleaning. This appaers to be due to the many places grass still managers to lodge, which the spray does not reach well enough to dislodge when using the washout port.',

                review: 'Ok so the primary reason I looked at a Honda lawnmower was the their reputation online and via the home depot in-store rep for good engines. I figured that\'s got to be the main thing you look at for long term value.So as expected the engine is strong.The acceleration control tabs things are awesome.Didn\'t have that feature when I bought my last lawn mower 15 years ago (we\'ve been living in condos so didn\'t have the need for one). The double blade thing is awesome and lives up to the videos describing it. It turns the mulch into such small pieces that even in relatively thick grass. And lastly the power on this thing is awesome.',

                review: 'This is simply the best self-propelled mower in its class. The twin blade cutting system blows away the competition. It does everything extremely well and has the renowned Honda quality and reliability to boot. My old Honda HRT lasted 12+ years and was still going strong when I sold it used and replaced it with this new HRR. I actually really like the new variable drive system on this mower.My cutting time went down about 30% because I can cut faster in the open sections yet still slow down for trimming work around bushes and trees without having to stop and shift gears.You almost have to run behind this mower at maximum speed - it is that fast.',

My neighbor told my husband he should get me a self propelled as he watched me pushing our old mower up and down our front lawn so that was a consideration. The Honda reviews were great. I went to Home Depot and the lady there helped me put it in my car and I was thrilled. Got it out of my car, set it up myself and was off and racing. That was October and it DID take a couple pulls to start each time and I was concerned -- but this spring it\'s been PERFECT, one pull and it starts.Bag is great.Easy to pull off and put back on and one pull start again to keep moving.Bravo Honda!',

This 22 foot ladder from Gorilla will get the job done on the outside of a home as well as those extension ladders, but this one you can fold in half for storage. No ropes needed. Plus it\'s relatively easy to carry.It is on the heavy side but in my opinion, any Joe Weekend won\'t have any trouble. This ladder is extremely well built. Excellent balance. Excellent weight to keep you in place when having to use it on soft material such as grass.The locking mechanisms were easy to use compared to my other two ladders. Simply twist them and they lock.

                review: 'I\'ve been looking at these multi- position ladders for a long time.I finally had a need for a ladder taller than a 6 foot step ladder.I took a look at what Home Depot had and this one jumped out at me.I\'ve only used it a couple of times, but it\'s worked wonderfully.I extended it most of the way to take down an antenna the previous owner left on the chimney.There was the typical ladder bounce, but I never felt unsafe climbing it.I also adjusted it to the tallest A frame ladder and was able to climb onto my roof. Some other reviews complain about the weight of the ladder.It is a little heavy, but it\'s much lighter than having a 22\' extension ladder, 9\' A frame ladder and a 5\' A frame ladder.And the convenience of folding it down into a smaller space for storage really makes up for the weight.',

Product: I have no complaints.It\'s fast, quiet, and looks nice. Very Spacious (1.6 cu ft). Will definitely buy another GE and from Home Depot. One little thing, all appliance models at Home Depot are in white.I had to special order and waited for about 5 days for the black model. ',

This is a very poorly designed handle. Most people are not going to be tall enough to grab the handle at its center. I am fairly tall woman at 5\' 8". I believe that the majority of people will grab the handle near the bottom. The top and bottom of the handle are made up of several parts. I am not a weight lifter and didn\'t do anything but grab the handle and pull on it. That should not cause the handle to break off. I will never buy a GE product again if I can help it.',

The second fridge had what I thought was a minor crack on a plastic clip. I tried calling Home Depot but kept getting routed to Whirlpool through their baffling phone menu system. Whirlpool would not do an exchange and insisted on sending a service technician. I relented, even though I paid for a new fridge, and scheduled a service call. The technician determined the frame was bent, the condenser fan shroud was cracked and the fan was not spinning and not blowing air across the condenser. No wonder the fridge was so noisy.',

The freezer is also so large that we haven\'t filled it yet.We bought this as a Christmas gift for ourselves and we are very happy and to top it all off, it was on sale.I would buy it again in a heartbeat.',

This one bolted up directly without any changes. I had to remove the factory installed power cord and wire the disposal directly (I assume that\'s according to code when the house was built, so I didn\'t change it and personally saw no reason to convert to a plug). If you have to hardwire it, I recommend disconnecting the disposal from the sink (easy to do), flip it over, remove the cover, rewire the disposal and reattach to the sink.',

                review: 'The blades are sharp, and appearently decent quality. However, standard blades are 19mm wide, which translates to 0.748 inches. The Husky blades are 0.754 inches, which on some Stanley knives is too wide to fit properly. I tried this on two Stanley knives. I consider this dimensional failure to be a big thing, as it means these blades do not "Fit most utility knives". If they fit your knife, then I would recommend them, but you would have to buy a pack to find out.',

Scoring drywall goes so much quicker and neater when you have blades available to swap out when they get dull, and this package makes it easy to safely store the old blade and to dispense a new one. The rachetting tabs on the back of the dispenser help to keep the new blades tight and the corresponding guide indicates how many fresh blades remain. As a valuable bonus, these blades are made in the USA and are very well priced.',

This unit works great! It requires a C wire to operate. The old mercury switch did not have the C wire so I had to hook up a wire to the C wire location on the board inside the A/C handler. Be sure to shut your power off and only install this if you are confident in your abilities. The WiFi feature was an added bonus cause initially I didn\'t want the feature, I have grown to like it.It is nice when you are in bed and want to change the temperature without getting out of bed.',

                review: 'After 24 years of reliable service the old toilet gave up, and after much research, I decided on this make and model. Installing the new toilet was somewhat of a challenge, since toilet dimensions have changed in 24 years. The first was the toilet shutoff valve was too close the back of the new toilet so that the shut valve handle would not turn without hitting the toilet. I had to remove new toilet and cut out drywall to move the valve slightly over. The other advice I have is this toilet is a one piece design, so it is heavy and awkward to lift and place over the hold down bolts, and making sure you are aligning the wax ring correctly to the floor flange. This was trying in a small space! ',

When choked, the clasp of the hook will tear into the edge of the strap as shown in my pictures. The small diameter of the hooks is also an issue of hooking to a larger pin (i.e. shackles, adapt-a-ball pins, etc.).

                review: 'I just bought this today and after unpacking it, I am very impressed with its form and functionality. It has great suction and everything stores pretty compact. We downsized from an old Ridgid 12gal to conserve garage space. I like the long cord and the smaller diameter hose. This will be great for vacuuming our cars and cleaning spots out of the carpet.',

They are pretty standard adjustable wrenches, so there no surprises to report, but I\'ll offer my thoughts on a few minor details in case you are looking at other brands and want to compare. They have a vinyl grip that makes them comfortable to hold, and the bright yellow grip makes them nice and visible in a toolbox. They have a machined jaw area which gives them a clean, crisp look, and gives them a precise feel.But all of the edges of the jaw are relatively sharp, as they have not been "broken" or rounded at all.',

                review: 'When this cart came, I put it together by myself. It took maybe an hour. I used 13mm (1/2") socket with an extension and ratchet and a wrench the same size. I also used a medium sized crescent wrench and a flat headed screwdriver. I went on line to see a video on how to assemble it. The directions were fair, but the video helped. I bought this cart to haul groceries from the car to the house as I can\'t walk that well. I will also use it to help haul trash bags to the big garbage can. I\'ll use a piece of plastic in the cart to separate cart from trash.All in all my use will be for light weight items.',

The price tag is pretty high, but just lift the lid and compare that weight to its $200 counterpart. The difference is the gauge steel Weber uses. That\'s the exact reason people can have a Weber grill for 15 plus years(assuming its covered and stored properly.) I was buying a $200 grill every 1.5-2 years due to rot out of either the drip pan, or the legs falling apart.This thing will last me a very long time, and the 10 year warranty is very nice to have as well!.',

I probably would not use it other than hauling dirt as you get what you pay for, but I am happy with it.',

The brackets that hold the wheel and axle in place were not assembled right thus causing the wheel to slide on the axle about 3 inches side to side as i made turns almost causing the wheel barrow to tip over on the side when you made a turn. So i had to had to loosen the brackets that hold the wheel on and move them both inwards towards the wheel. This stopped the wheel from sliding side to side. So it was not properly assembled. The pictures I am pointing at the brackets i had to loosen and move in towards the wheel. ',

First, the front wheel guard, juts out too far past the tire, which hits any obstacles such as a ramp, or small step, which makes the operator have to stoop down while passing over these transitions. Second is the flat proof tire. It\'s soft, so it only carries medium weight loads, beyond that, it feels like a flat tire.And third, the brackets holding on the wheel axle are thin, which bend back under heavy loads.I used this wheelbarrow to transport soil, from backyard to front yard, and load into a trailer.Rather disappointing.On the positive side, the handles are comfortable, and the steel barrow is sturdy.',

                review: 'Before this Dyson I owned a phenomenal Kenmore vacuum. When I purchased the Kenmore about 10 years ago, I compared it to the top-of-the-line Dyson that was available at that time. Surprisingly, the Kenmore had a stronger suction and more convenient tool selection, so I went with that model instead. Well, after a decade of great performance, my Kenmore was ready for retirement and I was ready to give Dyson another try... and boy am I glad I did! This Animal 2 Upright Vacuum is everything I wanted and more! The first time I used it I picked up SO much debris that my old Kenmore had been leaving behind! ',

                review: 'I had been waiting to finally upgrade our vacuum cleaner to a Dyson one suited for pet owners. Unfortunately this purchase (January 2019) has a been very bitter experience from an expensive investment. It works very well on hard floor but that\'s not what people buy a Dyson for, a manual sweep takes care of hard flooring.It\'s the carpet that I was hoping to get a good vacuuming out if. It is absolutely impossible to move this vacuum cleaner on any of our three types of rugs we own, none of which are out of ordinary type rugs. They all have smooth flat surfaces, so not a hairy type coarse rugs or carpets by any means. As far as I am concerned, this vacuum cleaner isn\'t really fit for purpose. ',

                review: 'I just finished reading all the 1-star reviews and I agree with most of them. The vacuum does have powerful suction. However, the vacuum does not work well on carpet as it is difficult to move and the beater bar shuts off. My carpet is not totally flat, it does have some nap to it, but I would consider it average for many homes. As for using the tools on the extension hose, it is very difficult. The hose wants to go back to the vacuum and it is a constant battle to keep the hose extended. If Dyson were to modify this vacuum by putting a manual height adjustment on and allowing the user to select the height needed for their carpet I think it would work well. ',
